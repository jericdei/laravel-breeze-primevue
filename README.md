# Laravel Breeze - PrimeVue

This is a very minimal boilerplate to quickly set up a Laravel project with Vue.js as the frontend.

## Tech Stack

-   Laravel 10
-   Vue.js 3
-   Inertia.js
-   PrimeVue (Styled)
-   Tailwind CSS
-   TypeScript

---

Although this boilerplate uses Laravel Breeze, only `Login` and `Register` pages are included for better start.
